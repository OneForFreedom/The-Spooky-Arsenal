Okay got fusion fired up for my second week of fusion cadding!!

Yes sadly this is also retrospective, I didn't find time to journal within the day. But it is what it is.

Here are my first (2) bloodied weapon(s). I spent slightly above 2 hours for each one. Ima low ball and say I spent:

Hours taken: 4.3
Total Hours taken:  4.3

(P.S each one is made seperately, the only thing that is the same is the sketches. The one on the right is optimized for 3d printing, they should be roughly identical when looked at top-down)

## I'm Making a Gun!

This should hopefully take like 11 hours, (5.5hrs on each)
 
I mean.. What better way to turn the tables on those nasty trick or treaters then to just point a gun at them and blast their consciousness away.

Note that this is a non functional model and is to not be used for purposes other then cosplay and prop use. If this gets you into any sort of trouble, then the fault is 100% on you.

Hours spent 0.5
Total hours spent 4.8

## Finished the sketch!

Okay, I finished making the sketch for the gun (with like almost 500 failed iterations (I'm bluffing))

But it was hard asf and im really proud on how it turned out!

I personally know I spent wayyyy too long on ts

 ## started the extruding! 

 Okay I'm starting to extrude this. I had to open a new file to prevent my pc from bsoding - for the fourth time :hs:

 Its going fine. I have the tip mostly done. Oh I just realised I am gonna have to color this gun :pf: 

 wish me luck!

P.S This image isnt just one extrude, its multiple extrudes at different hieghts

Time taken: 1h
Total time taken 9h

## Finished extruding! 

I finished doing all the extrusions, so now i just got the boring filleting and the colouring! I estimate that itll be done in the next 5 hours (I hope)

Time taken : 1h
Total time taken: 10h

## Fillet a gun with oil!

Okay all fillets are done - hopefully. 
This took me quite a bit of time as i filleted everything, every vertex, everything.

Time Taken : 3H
Total time taken: 13h

## Finally done!

I'm finally done desigining the gun! If I'm being honest, it was roughly a waste of time as it is visual and the colour doesn't actually get printed. But I'm doing it for the looks, Right?

Oh yeah I also made bullets!
