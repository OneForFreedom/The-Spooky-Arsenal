## 11/4/2025 - I. Mean. Business.  

Okay got fusion fired up for my second week of fusion cadding!!

Yes sadly this is also retrospective, I didn't find time to journal within the day. But it is what it is.

Here are my first (2) bloodied weapon(s). I spent slightly above 2 hours for each one. Ima low ball and say I spent:

Hours taken: 4.3
Total Hours taken:  4.3

(P.S each one is made seperately, the only thing that is the same is the sketches. The one on the right is optimized for 3d printing, they should be roughly identical when looked at top-down)

I'm Making a Gun!

This should hopefully take like 11 hours, (5.5hrs on each)
 
I mean.. What better way to turn the tables on those nasty trick or treaters then to just point a gun at them and blast their consciousness away.

Note that this is a non functional model and is to not be used for purposes other then cosplay and prop use. If this gets you into any sort of trouble, then the fault is 100% on you.
